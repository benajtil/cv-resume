    aboutme: `Hey, I‚Äôm Ben Florence A.J. Til, a Computer Science graduate from Notre Dame of Marbel University (NDMU) and a self-taught tech enthusiast. Back in high school, I got curious about how computers and bots worked. With zero coding knowledge, I started by copying existing open-source projects, tweaking them, breaking things, fixing them ‚Äî and somehow making them work. I ended up building my own music bots, RSS APIs, and even Discord bots with custom commands. I also managed a small private server and became a database manager, all while learning things the hard way.

    That curiosity never stopped. I‚Äôve built PCs, fixed electronics, repaired phones, wired WiFi-connected vending machines ‚Äî all without formal training in electronics. I didn‚Äôt know anything about amperes or circuits, I just figured things out by doing.
\n I may not always feel like I fully ‚Äúfit‚Äù into a role right away, but one thing I‚Äôm sure of: I‚Äôll learn it, adapt, and make it work.

`,
